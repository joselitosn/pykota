You're welcome to redistribute this software under the

============================================================

  * PyKota is distributed under the GNU General Public License

  * You can access to PyKota's source code by using CVS from :
  
        http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pykota/

  * The CVS version will always be labelled as **unofficial** and the 
    word **unofficial** will appear whenever you run PyKota command line 
    tools with the --version command line argument, and so I have to 
    make a restriction : 

    YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE TO LABEL A VERSION OF 
    PyKota DOWNLOADED FROM CVS AS BEING THE 'OFFICIAL' ONE.

  * A PyKota version obtained from CVS, i.e. which version number 
    looks like *x.xx-unofficial*, IS FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE, AT NO COST, 
    UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, BUT CAN'T BE 
    LABELLED 'OFFICIAL'. THIS MEANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED, UNDER ANY 
    CIRCUMSTANCES, TO DELETE THE 'UNOFFICIAL' WORD FROM THE VERSION 
    NUMBER. 

  * Version number excepted, **THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
    'OFFICIAL' and 'UNOFFICIAL' VERSIONS OF PyKota.** It should be clear 
    that I'll answer to all questions, and try to help as much as I can, 
    even if you don't want to buy an **'OFFICIAL'** version. But it 
    should also be clear to you that the latest version you can find in 
    CVS may be somewhat unstable or unfinished, since this software is a 
    work in progress, and that it's up to you to download working 
    revisions from the CVS tree. That's why I suggest that you purchase 
    an 'OFFICIAL' version, because it will be simpler for you. 

  * You can obtain an **'OFFICIAL'** version of PyKota in two forms :

    * Electronic form :

      * You pay me any amount of money starting at **15$ (US Dollars)**

      * Then I send you the latest **PyKota 'OFFICIAL'** tarball, 
        including the latest version of the electronic documentation in 
        SGML, HTML and PDF formats, by email. 

    * CDROM + Paper documentation (not yet available, documentation 
      still under works) : 

      * You pay me any amount of money starting at **30$ (US Dollars)**

      * Then I send you the latest **PyKota 'OFFICIAL'** tarball, 
        including the latest version of the electronic documentation in 
        SGML, HTML and PDF formats, on CDROM, accompanied with the latest 
        version of the printed documentation. No additionnal shipping costs 
        will be asked to you, unless you require a specific delivery mode. 

  * The purchase of an **'OFFICIAL'** 
    version entitles you to : 

    * Redistribute the **'OFFICIAL'** version you purchased. But if you 
      modify this version before redistribution then I ask you to also 
      modify the version number present in the pykota/version.py file to 
      label any package you would redistribute as **'UNOFFICIAL'**. 
      Unmodified **'OFFICIAL'** packages can be redistributed freely under 
      the **'OFFICIAL'** label. 

    * Obtain free technical support for a year starting at your purchase 
      date (bug fixes and new official versions) 

    * Obtain half of **your money back** in case you contribute source 
      code or documentation which I accept in the source tree. If you're a 
      motivated developper, you've got strong chances to get half of your 
      money back. *NB : You will have to send me a signed copyright 
      assignment on paper in order for me to be able to accept your 
      patches on PyKota.* 

I sincerely hope that you will find this proposition as fair as I do 
think it is.
