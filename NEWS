PyKota NEWS :

    - 0.98 :
    
        - Correctly handle the case where the printer is switched off.
        
        - Small bug wrt syslog fixed.
        
    - 0.97 :
    
        - edpykota accepts wildcards on its command line for users/groups too
          if the --add option is not set, e.g. :
          
              $ edpykota --printer lp --softlimit 50 --hardlimit 100 "jer*"
              
        - If no user name is passed at all, then a default wildcard of "*"
          which means apply the command on ALL users for this printer is used.
          
        - Small bug fixes.
        
    - 0.96 :

        - Options requester, policy, admin, adminmail and gracedelay can now
          be set either globally or per printer. The printer option has
          priority if both are defined.

        - More powerful configuration parser.
        
        - If all options are defined globally, there's no need to 
          define a section for each printer in the configuration
          file anymore. Just define a [global] section and it's ok.

    - 0.95 :

        - External requesters for printers finally added.

        - Full internationalization (english and french are supported)
 
        - More complete quota usage report

        - CGI script to access to the quota usage report

        - Several bugs fixed.
