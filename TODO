============================================================

TODO, in no particular order :

        - Add pre and post job external hooks, per printer, and
          export necessary environment variables.
          
        - Export PYKOTAPHASE environment variable, containing
          either "BEFORE" or "AFTER" for the external requester.
        
        - Ensures data are stored in a consistent way with Unicode.
        
        - Allow the --ingroups command line option to repykota, to
          report only users members of the specified groups.
          
        - Documentation...
          
        - Complete web administrative interface with graphical reports.
       
        - Group administrators (think quotagrpdmins for disk quotas).
          Won't be implemented for now.
