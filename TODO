============================================================

TODO, in no particular order :

        - Test and document a possible workaround for knowing
          if the job is a banner (embed a postscript comment
          in the banner).
          
        - pkusers --nogroup
          pkusers --ingroups gr1,gr2,... --outgroups gr3,gr4,...
          
        - Ensures data are stored in a consistent way with Unicode :
          I can't reproduce the problem.
        
        - Allow the --ingroups command line option to repykota, to
          report only users members of the specified groups.
          
        - Documentation...
          
        - Complete web administrative interface with graphical reports.
       
        - Group administrators (think quotagrpdmins for disk quotas).
          Won't be implemented for now.
