============================================================

TODO, in no particular order :
        
        - Allow the disabling of an user print quota entry without
          deleting it.
        
        - Store the value of the user's account balance in the
          printing history (the value at the time of printing) 
          as well as in the payments history (as a safety check
          in case an user complains).
          
        - Add a pkrefund command line tool & optional CGI script.
        
        - PJL for non-networked backends (see ML's history)
        
        - Make the SNMP and PJL delay and number of loops a new configuration
          directive.
        
        - Add the listing of the member printers in pkprinters if the printer
          is a printer group.
          
        - Allow several levels of administrative priviledges by allowing
          files like ~pykota/pykotadmin.someusername.conf (readonly by
          user 'someusername'), and have the database server deal
          with the permissions : no need for additionnal code or data
          in PyKota's database !
        
        - Try to talk to education based distribution coordinators
          (SambaEdu, SkoleLinux, K12LTSP, ...) to see how to
          better integrate PyKota with these.
          
        - Add most configuration directives to the database itself,
          while still allowing to overwrite them with the configuration
          files at run time.
        
        - Ink accounting ala PrintBill.
        
        - Price and statistics per page format.
        
        - Allow the admin to choose an action to take when the database
          is unavailable (server is down or something like that), so
          introduce two directives :
          
            nodb: accept|reject|hold
            lognodb: /path/to/file/for/later/batch/update/of/database
        
        - CUPS accepts the "STATE: ..." message as backchannel
          data : use this to tell CUPS what action has been taken
          for current job. I did some testing but wasn't able to
          make it work...
          
        - Documentation...
          
        - Learn more bits of PHP to help with phpPyKotaAdmin, which
          is a GREAT tool !
       
        - Multidatabase support, e.g. store users in LDAP, quota  
          related datas in PostgreSQL, history in text file,
          and so on... For 2.0, probably not before.
          
        - Re-add support for LPRng if interest is high enough (it is
          not for now)
