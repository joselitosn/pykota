TODO, in no particular order :
        
        - Very good idea from Martin Oesterund : comment field for
          payments !!!
          
        - Another one : add a third value like 'nocheck' or something
          like that to allow an user to print with no limitation while
          still updating the balance and number of pages printed.
          
        - Make the SNMP and PJL delay and number of loops a new configuration
          directive.
        
        - Ensure that deleted or modified entries are flushed from the cache.
        
        - Adds configurability to what happens when the user/group doesn't exist
          when running edpykota. Rewrite the main loop to be able to abort
          early, before any modification has taken place.
          
        - Add the listing of the member printers in pkprinters if the printer
          is a printer group.
          
        - Allow several levels of administrative priviledges by allowing
          files like ~pykota/pykotadmin.someusername.conf (readonly by
          user 'someusername'), and have the database server deal
          with the permissions : no need for additionnal code or data
          in PyKota's database !
        
        - Try to talk to education based distribution coordinators
          (SambaEdu, SkoleLinux, K12LTSP, ...) to see how to
          better integrate PyKota with these.
          
        - Allow soft and hard limits to be increased/decreased.
        
        - Add most configuration directives to the database itself,
          while still allowing to overwrite them with the configuration
          files at run time.
        
        - Ink accounting ala PrintBill.
        
        - Price and statistics per page format.
        
        - Allow the admin to choose an action to take when the database
          is unavailable (server is down or something like that), so
          introduce two directives :
          
            nodb: accept|reject|hold
            lognodb: /path/to/file/for/later/batch/update/of/database
        
        - CUPS accepts the "STATE: ..." message as backchannel
          data : use this to tell CUPS what action has been taken
          for current job. I did some testing but wasn't able to
          make it work...
          
        - Think about some possible client <=> PyKota dialog
          possibilities, like embedding a small web server in
          PyKota for example, or something like that.
        
        - Log something when --add is used with existing entries.
          Maybe add a new command line option to force/not force
          modification of existing entries.
          
        - Finish implementation of quota-then-balance and 
          balance-then-quota.
          
        - Introduce the pkusers command.
          pkusers --nogroup
          pkusers --ingroups gr1,gr2,... --outgroups gr3,gr4,...
          
        - Allow the --ingroups command line option to repykota, to
          report only users members of the specified groups.
          
        - Documentation...
          
        - Learn more bits of PHP to help with phpPyKotaAdmin, which
          is a GREAT tool !
       
        - Multidatabase support, e.g. store users in LDAP, quota  
          related datas in PostgreSQL, history in text file,
          and so on... For 2.0, probably not before.
