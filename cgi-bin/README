This directory contains CGI scripts which you may find useful to
put on a web server along with PyKota command line tools.

Be sure to restrict access to these CGI scripts as necessary.

The web server doesn't need to be a print server nor a PyKota 
Storage Backend server, but it must contain a correctly configured 
PyKota installation.
