====================================================================

This directory contains sample configuration files for PyKota.
You can copy them to /etc/pykota/pykota.conf and
/etc/pykota/pykotadmin.conf and adapt them to your needs.

Don't forget to protect /etc/pykota/pykotadmin.conf from being
readable by normal users since it contains sensitive informations
which may allow people to modify their own quota information.

Under Debian GNU/Linux with CUPS :
        
        $ chmod 644 /etc/pykota/pykota.conf
        $ chmod 640 /etc/pykota/pykotadmin.conf
        $ chown root.root /etc/pykota/pykota.conf
        $ chown lp.lpadmin /etc/pykota/pykotadmin.conf
