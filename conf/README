====================================================================

This directory contains sample configuration files for PyKota.
You can copy them to ~pykota/pykota.conf and
~pykota/pykotadmin.conf and adapt them to your needs.

Don't forget to protect ~pykota/pykotadmin.conf from being
readable by normal users since it contains sensitive informations
which may allow people to modify their own quota information.

Please refer to the toplevel README, the SECURITY document, and
the complete documentation for details about this.
