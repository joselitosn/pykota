This is a simple mysql history script contributed by 
Matt Hyclak <hyclak@math.ohiou.edu>

To use, place the mysql_history.conf file in your pykota config directory. 
This is located in the pykota user's home directory, or as a last resort in 
/etc/pykota. Modify the variables to match your setup.

The mysql_history.py should be called from a posthook script. No variables need
be passed to the script, as it extracts everything from the environment 
variables set by Pykota.

The history.sql file includes the SQL statements to create the database used
by the mysql_history.py program. This can be extended fairly trivially if you 
wish to capture extra data.
