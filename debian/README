============================================================

This directory contains scripts you may find interesting to
use on a Debian GNU/Linux system.

They try to mimic the disk quota tools configuration on
Debian :

        - /etc/default/printquota -- defines if the 
          print quota warning sender is to be launched in
          cron.daily
          
        - /etc/cron.daily/printquota -- warns users above  
          their print quota, using /usr/bin/warnpykota
