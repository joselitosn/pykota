The author's wishes do not make the software DFSG non-free, since the
official/non-official distinction is a request, not a requirement. That said,
the debian package complies with the author's wishes and is labelled as
unofficial; I encourage you to support free software and buy an official
version if pykota turns out to be useful for you.
