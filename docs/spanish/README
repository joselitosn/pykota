          This file was generously contributed to this project 
          by Dennis Romero L. I've added two paragraphs in
          Helvetica 12 Italic, one describing the warning below.
          
          WARNING : This file only describes installation for 
          PyKota v1.15, and not PyKota v1.16 or above, which is a bit
          different. Please refer to the toplevel README file for
          v1.16 specific instructions.
