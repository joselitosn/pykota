options :
.TP
\fB\-v\fR | \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints edpykota's version number then exits.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints this message then exits.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR | \fB\-\-add\fR
Adds users and/or printers if they don't
exist on the Quota Storage Server.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-delete\fR
Deletes users/groups from the quota storage.
Printers are never deleted.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR | \fB\-\-charge\fR p[,j]
Sets the price per page and per job to charge
for a particular printer. Job price is optional.
If both are to be set, separate them with a comma.
Floating point values are allowed.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR | \fB\-\-ingroups\fR g1[,g2...]
Puts the users into each of the groups
listed, separated by commas. The groups
must already exist in the Quota Storage.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR | \fB\-\-users\fR
Edit users print quotas, this is the default.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR | \fB\-\-printer\fR p
Edit quotas on printer p only. Actually p can
use wildcards characters to select only
some printers. The default value is *, meaning
all printers.
You can specify several names or wildcards,
by separating them with commas.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR | \fB\-\-pgroups\fR pg1[,pg2...] Adds the printer(s) to the printer groups
pg1, pg2, etc... which must already exist.
A printer group is just like a normal printer,
only that it is usually unknown from the printing
system. Create printer groups exactly the same
way that you create printers, then add other
printers to them with this option.
Accounting is done on a printer and on all
the printer groups it belongs to, quota checking
is done on a printer and on all the printer groups
it belongs to.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR | \fB\-\-groups\fR
Edit users groups print quotas instead of users.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR | \fB\-\-prototype\fR u|g Uses user u or group g as a prototype to set
print quotas
.TP
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-noquota\fR
Doesn't set a quota but only does accounting.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR | \fB\-\-reset\fR
Resets the printed page counter for the user
or group to zero. The life time page counter
is kept unchanged.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR | \fB\-\-limitby\fR l
Choose if the user/group is limited in printing
by its account balance or by its page quota.
The default value is 'quota'. Allowed values
are 'quota' 'balance' 'quota-then-balance' and
\&'balance-then-quota'.
WARNING : quota-then-balance and balance-then-quota
are not yet implemented.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR | \fB\-\-balance\fR b
Sets the user's account balance to b.
Account balance may be increase or decreased
if b is prefixed with + or -.
WARNING : when decreasing account balance,
the total paid so far by the user is decreased
too.
Groups don't have a real balance, but the
sum of their users' account balance.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR | \fB\-\-softlimit\fR sl
Sets the quota soft limit to sl pages.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR | \fB\-\-hardlimit\fR hl
Sets the quota hard limit to hl pages.

if the \fB\-\-add\fR option is not set.

examples :
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --add -p jerome john paul george ringo/ringo@example.com\fR
.IP
This will add users john, paul, george and ringo to the quota
database, and set their print quotas to the same values than user
jerome. User jerome must already exist.
User ringo's email address will also be set to 'ringo@example.com'
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --printer lp -S 50 -H 60 jerome\fR
.IP
This will set jerome's print quota on the lp printer to a soft limit
of 50 pages, and a hard limit of 60 pages. If either user jerome or
printer lp doesn't exist on the Quota Storage Server then nothing is done.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --add --printer lp --ingroups coders,it -S 50 -H 60 jerome\fR
.IP
Same as above, but if either user jerome or printer lp doesn't exist
on the Quota Storage Server they are automatically added. Also
user jerome is put into the groups "coders" and "it" which must
already exist in the Quota Storage.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota -g -S 500 -H 550 financial support\fR
.IP

.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --reset jerome "jo*"\fR

Their life time page counter on each printer will be kept unchanged.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --printer hpcolor --noquota jerome\fR
.IP
This will tell PyKota to not limit jerome when printing on the
hpcolor printer. All his jobs will be allowed on this printer, but
accounting of the pages he prints will still be kept.
Print Quotas for jerome on other printers are unchanged.
