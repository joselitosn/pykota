examples :
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota -p jerome john paul george ringo\fR
.IP
This will set print quotas for the users john, paul, george and ringo
to the same values than user jerome. User jerome must exist.

.IP
This will set jerome's print quota on the lp printer to a soft limit
of 50 pages, and a hard limit of 60 pages. If either user jerome or

.IP
Same as above, but if either user jerome or printer lp doesn't exist
on the Quota Storage Server they are automatically added. Also
user jerome is put into the groups "coders" and "it" which must
already exist in the Quota Storage.
WARNING : the CUPS PPD file for this printer or the /etc/printcap

must still be

modified manually, as well as pykota's configuration file
for a new printer to be managed successfully.
.IP

well as every user whose name begins with 'jo'.
Their life time page counter on each printer will be kept unchanged.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --printer hpcolor --noquota jerome\fR
