edpykota \- manual page for edpykota (PyKota) 1.27alpha14_unofficial
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B edpykota
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIusernames|groupnames\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Manages PyKota print quota entries for users or users groups. A print quota
entry is related to both an user and a printer, or to both a group and a
printer, meaning that for example different users can have different page
count limits on the same printer. If an user doesn't have a print quota entry
on a particular printer, he won't be allowed to print to it.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
show the version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR ARGUMENTSFILE, \fB\-\-arguments\fR=\fIARGUMENTSFILE\fR
loads additional options and arguments from a file,
one per line.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-add\fR
Add new, or modify existing, users or groups print
quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
Delete the specified users or groups print quota
entries. When deleting users print quota entries, the
matching jobs are also deleted from the printing
history.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR SOFTLIMIT, \fB\-\-softlimit\fR=\fISOFTLIMIT\fR
Set the soft page count limit for the specified print
quota entries. Users can print over this limit for a
number of days specified in the 'gracedelay' directive
in pykota.conf
.TP
\fB\-H\fR HARDLIMIT, \fB\-\-hardlimit\fR=\fIHARDLIMIT\fR
Set the hard page count limit for the specified print
quota entries. Users are never allowed to print over
this limit.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-groups\fR
Manage groups print quota entries instead of users
print quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR INCREASE, \fB\-\-increase\fR=\fIINCREASE\fR
Increase the existing soft and hard page count limits
for the specified print quota entries. You can
decrease the values instead by prefixing this
parameter with a negative sign.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
Display detailed informations about the specified
users or groups print quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR MAXJOBSIZE, \fB\-\-maxjobsize\fR=\fIMAXJOBSIZE\fR
Set the maximum job size in pages the specified users
are allowed to print to the specified printers in a
single job. Accepted values are '0' to forbid
printing, 'unlimited' to allow unrestricted printing,
or any positive integer value. This option is not
supported for users groups.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noquota\fR
Set no limit for both soft and hard page counts for
the specified users or groups print quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR PRINTER, \fB\-\-printer\fR=\fIPRINTER\fR
Specify a comma separated list of printers you want to
manage print quota entries on. The default is '*',
meaning all printers.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reset\fR
Reset the actual page counter for the specified users
print quota entries (doesn't work for groups print
quota entries). The life time page counter is left
unchanged.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-hardreset\fR
Reset the actual and life time page counters for the
specified users print quota entries (doesn't work for
groups print quota entries). This is a shortcut for
\fB\-\-used\fR 0.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-skipexisting\fR
If \fB\-\-add\fR is used, ensure that existing users or groups
print quota entries won't be modified.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR USED, \fB\-\-used\fR=\fIUSED\fR
Set the values of both the actual and life time page
counters for the specified users print quota entries
(doesn't work for groups print quota entries). This
can be useful when migrating from a different print
quota software. The values can also be increased or
decreased by prefixing this parameter with either a
positive or negative sign.
.SS "examples:"
.IP
edpykota \fB\-\-add\fR john paul george ringo
Would create print quota entries with no page count limits for these four
users on all existing printers.
.IP
edpykota \fB\-\-printer\fR HP \fB\-\-softlimit\fR 50 \fB\-\-hardlimit\fR 60 jerome
Would allow user 'jerome' to print up to 60 pages on printer 'HP'. This
user would be warned when he would have reached 50 pages on this printer.
Both the user and printer must have been created previously using the
pkusers and pkprinters commands, respectively.
.IP
edpykota \fB\-\-groups\fR \fB\-\-softlimit\fR 500 \fB\-\-hardlimit\fR 600 support financial
Would set soft and hard page count limits on any printer for groups
\&'support' and 'financial'.
.IP
edpykota \fB\-\-reset\fR \fB\-\-printer\fR HP jerome "jo*"
Would reset the actual page counter for users 'jerome' and all users whose
name begins with 'jo' on printer 'HP'.
.IP
edpykota \fB\-\-printer\fR HPCOLOR \fB\-\-noquota\fR jerome
Would allow this user to print without any page limit on printer
\&'HPCOLOR'. Depending on how this user is limited, he may still be subject
to being limited by the number of available credits in his account.
.IP
edpykota \fB\-\-add\fR \fB\-\-skipexisting\fR
Would create a print quota entry for each user on each printer for which
none already existed. You'll most likely want to use this command at least
once after initial setup.
