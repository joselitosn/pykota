.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pkturnkey
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIprinter1 printer2 \fR... \fIprinterN\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
A turn key tool for PyKota. When launched, this command will initialize
PyKota's database with all existing print queues and some or all users. For
now, no prices or limits are set, so printing is fully accounted for, but not
limited. That's why you'll probably want to also use edpykota once the
database has been initialized.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
show the version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR ARGUMENTSFILE, \fB\-\-arguments\fR=\fIARGUMENTSFILE\fR
loads additional options and arguments from a file,
one per line.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-doconf\fR
Try to autodetect the best print accounting settings
for existing CUPS printers. All printers must be
switched ON beforehand.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dousers\fR
Create accounts for users, and allocate print quota
entries for them.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-dogroups\fR
Create accounts for users groups, and allocate print
quota entries for them.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-emptygroups\fR
Also include groups which don't have any member.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Modifies PyKota's database content for real, instead
of faking it (for safety reasons).
.TP
\fB\-u\fR UIDMIN, \fB\-\-uidmin\fR=\fIUIDMIN\fR
Only include users whose uid is greater than or equal
to this parameter. If you pass an username instead,
his uid will be used automatically.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR UIDMAX, \fB\-\-uidmax\fR=\fIUIDMAX\fR
Only include users whose uid is lesser than or equal
to this parameter. If you pass an username instead,
his uid will be used automatically.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR GIDMIN, \fB\-\-gidmin\fR=\fIGIDMIN\fR
Only include users groups whose gid is greater than or
equal to this parameter. If you pass a groupname
instead, its gid will be used automatically.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR GIDMAX, \fB\-\-gidmax\fR=\fIGIDMAX\fR
Only include users groups whose gid is lesser than or
equal to this parameter. If you pass a groupname
instead, its gid will be used automatically.
.SS "examples:"
.IP
pkturnkey \fB\-\-dousers\fR \fB\-\-uidmin\fR jerome HPLASER1 HPLASER2
Would simulate the creation in PyKota's database of the printing accounts
for all users whose uid is greater than or equal to 'jerome''s. Each of
them would be given a print quota entry on printers 'HPLASER1' and
\&'HPLASER2'.
.IP
pkturnkey \fB\-\-force\fR \fB\-\-dousers\fR \fB\-\-uidmin\fR jerome HPLASER1 HPLASER2
Would do the same as the example above, but for real. Please take great
care when using the \fB\-\-force\fR command line option.
.IP
pkturnkey \fB\-\-doconf\fR
Would try to automatically detect the best print accounting settings for
all active printers, and generate some lines for you to add into your
pykota.conf
