.SS "filtering expressions:"
.IP
Use the filtering expressions to extract only parts of the datas. Allowed
filters are of the form 'key=value'. Wildcards are not expanded as part of
these filtering expressions, so you can't use them here.
.IP
allowed keys for now:
.IP
username : User's name
printername : Printer's name
hostname : Host's name
jobid : Job's id
billingcode : Job's billing code
start : Job's date of printing
end : Job's date of printing
.IP
formatting of dates with the 'start' and 'end' filtering keys:
.IP
YYYY : year boundaries
YYYYMM : month boundaries
YYYYMMDD : day boundaries
YYYYMMDDhh : hour boundaries
YYYYMMDDhhmm : minute boundaries
YYYYMMDDhhmmss : second boundaries
yesterday[+\-N] : yesterday more or less N days (e.g. : yesterday\-15)
today[+\-N] : today more or less N days (e.g. : today\-15)

now[+\-N] : now more or less N days (e.g. now\-15)
.IP
\&'now' and 'today' are not exactly the same since 'today' represents the
first or last second of the day depending on if it's used in a 'start=' or
\&'end=' date expression.
