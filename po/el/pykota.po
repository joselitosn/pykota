"\n"
"  $ edpykota --add -p jerome john paul george ringo/ringo@example.com\n"

"  jerome. User jerome must already exist.\n"
"  User ringo's email address will also be set to 'ringo@example.com'\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --printer lp -S 50 -H 60 jerome\n"
"  \n"
"  This will set jerome's print quota on the lp printer to a soft limit\n"
"  of 50 pages, and a hard limit of 60 pages. If either user jerome or\n"
"  printer lp doesn't exist on the Quota Storage Server then nothing is "
"done.\n"
"\n"
"  $ edpykota --add --printer lp --ingroups coders,it -S 50 -H 60 jerome\n"
"  \n"
"  Same as above, but if either user jerome or printer lp doesn't exist \n"
"  on the Quota Storage Server they are automatically added. Also\n"
"  user jerome is put into the groups \"coders\" and \"it\" which must\n"
"  already exist in the Quota Storage.\n"
"            \n"
"  $ edpykota -g -S 500 -H 550 financial support            \n"
"  \n"
"  This will set print quota soft limit to 500 pages and hard limit\n"
"  to 550 pages for groups financial and support on all printers.\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --reset jerome \"jo*\"\n"
"  \n"
"  This will reset jerome's page counter to zero on all printers, as\n"
"  well as every user whose name begins with 'jo'.\n"
"  Their life time page counter on each printer will be kept unchanged.\n"
"  You can also reset the life time page counters by using the\n"
"  --hardreset | -R command line option.\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --printer hpcolor --noquota jerome\n"
"  \n"
"  This will tell PyKota to not limit jerome when printing on the \n"
"  hpcolor printer. All his jobs will be allowed on this printer, but \n"
"  accounting of the pages he prints will still be kept.\n"
"  Print Quotas for jerome on other printers are unchanged.\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --limitby balance jerome\n"
"  \n"
"  This will tell PyKota to limit jerome by his account's balance\n"
"  when printing.\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --balance +10.0 jerome\n"
"  \n"
"  This will increase jerome's account balance by 10.0 (in your\n"
"  own currency). You can decrease the account balance with a\n"
"  dash prefix, and set it to a fixed amount with no prefix.\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --delete jerome rachel\n"
"  \n"
"  This will completely delete jerome and rachel from the Quota Storage\n"
"  database. All their quotas and jobs will be deleted too.\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --printer lp --charge 0.1\n"
"  \n"
"  This will set the page price for printer lp to 0.1. Job price\n"
"  will not be changed.\n"
"  \n"
"  $ edpykota --printer hplj1,hplj2 --pgroups Laser,HP\n"
"  \n"
"  This will put printers hplj1 and hplj2 in printers groups Laser and HP.\n"
"  When printing either on hplj1 or hplj2, print quota will also be \n"
"  checked and accounted for on virtual printers Laser and HP.\n"
