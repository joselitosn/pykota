============================================================

  * PyKota is distributed under the GNU General Public License
    which you can read in the file named COPYING.

  * You can access to PyKota's source code by using CVS from :
  
      http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pykota/

    Follow the "CVS Repository" link then follow the instructions in
    the section labeled "Getting a Copy of the CVS Repository". 

  * The CVS version will always be labelled as **unofficial** and the 
    word **unofficial** will appear whenever you run PyKota command line 
    tools with the *--version* command line argument. 

  * I ask you to not label or present a version of PyKota downloaded 
    from CVS as being the 'OFFICIAL' one. 

  * I encourage you to buy an 'OFFICIAL' PyKota package. See below for 
    the benefits of doing so. 

  * A PyKota version obtained either from CVS (unofficial) or by 
    purchasing an official package, **IS FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE AND 
    MODIFIABLE, AT NO COST, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC 
    LICENSE.** 

  * Version number excepted, **THERE'S NO SOURCE CODE DIFFERENCE 
    BETWEEN 'OFFICIAL' AND 'UNOFFICIAL' VERSIONS OF PyKota.** However it 
    should be clear to you that the latest version you can find in CVS 
    may be somewhat unstable or unfinished, since this software is a 
    work in progress, and that it's up to you to download working 
    revisions from the CVS tree. That's why I suggest that you purchase 
    an **'OFFICIAL'** version, because it will be simpler for you (and 
    better for me). Also the documentation included in the 
    **'UNOFFICIAL'** version is only delivered in DocBook XML/SGML 
    source form, and not in compiled forms like HTML or PDF. 

  * You can obtain an **'OFFICIAL'** version of PyKota in two forms :

    * Electronic form :

      * You pay me any amount of money starting at **15$ (US Dollars)**

      * Then I send you the latest **PyKota 'OFFICIAL'** tarball, 
        including the latest version of the electronic documentation in 
        SGML, HTML and PDF formats, by email. 

    * CDROM + Paper documentation *(not yet available, documentation 
      still under works)* : 

      * You pay me any amount of money starting at **30$ (US Dollars)**

      * Then I send you the latest **PyKota 'OFFICIAL'** tarball, 
        including the latest version of the electronic documentation in 
        SGML, HTML and PDF formats, on CDROM, accompanied with the latest 
        version of the printed documentation. No additionnal shipping costs 
        will be asked to you, unless you require a specific delivery mode. 

  * The "purchase":/software/PyKota/Purchase of an **'OFFICIAL'** 
    version also allows you to : 

    * Modify or redistribute the **'OFFICIAL'** version you purchased, 
      under the terms of the GNU General Public License of the Free 
      Software Foundation. I just ask you to remove the 'OFFICIAL' word 
      from the version number if you redistribute a modified official 
      version. 

    * Obtain free technical support for a year starting at your purchase 
      date : This includes bug fixes and new official versions, as well as 
      priority email support. 

    * Obtain half of **your money back** in case you contribute source 
      code or documentation which I accept in the source tree. If you're a 
      motivated developper, you've got strong chances to get half of your 
      money back. *NB : You will have to send me a signed copyright 
      assignment on paper in order for me to be able to accept your 
      patches on PyKota.* 

    * By purchasing an official package, your karma will also be better.

I sincerely hope that you will find this proposition as fair as I do 
think it is.
