PyKota NEWS :

    - 1.03alpha :
    
        - IMPORTANT : DataBase schema has changed.
          DON'T TRY TO UPGRADE AN EXISTING PYKOTA INSTALLATION !
          The upgrade script will be finalized ASAP, be patient,
          or drop your old quota database to start anew.
          
        - The new database schema allows to keep an history of all
          jobs as well as charge users per page and/or per job, 
          and track users' account balance.
          
        - edpykota now accepts much more command line options to  
          use the new functionnalities. See edpykota --help for
          details.
          
        - The installation script now allows to install the sample
          configuration file during first installation.
          
        - More group quota code works, but still not finished.  
        
        - The CGI script displays a link to PyKota's website.
        
        - The job history is now kept, this will allow per-period
          reports in the future.
          
        - After having modified the quota for an user with edpykota,
          a quota check is done to eventually warn the user/admin about
          a quota which is too low to print.
          
        - A workaround is provided for HP Printers : their internal
          page counter is only saved to NVRAM in a 10 increment, so
          if you switch them off and then on, the reported page counter
          may be lower than the real number of pages printed.
          See http://web.mit.edu/source/third/lprng/doc/LPRng-HOWTO-15.html
          We unconditionnally set the last job's page count to 
          abs(int((10 - abs(lastcounter(snmp) - lastcounter(storage)) / 2))
          in this case. 
          For a more accurate accounting, never switch your HP printers
          off.
          
        - A fix is provided for printers which only have a volatile  
          page counter (reset to 0 every time you switch the printer on)
          This should allow PyKota to work reasonably fine with HP Laserjet
          4L/5L/6L, not perfect, but better than nothing.
          See http://web.mit.edu/source/third/lprng/doc/LPRng-HOWTO-15.html
          For a more accurate accounting, never switch your HP printers
          off. This is untested, please report any problem.
          
        - A bug was fixed when edpykota --add was used with users who already
          had a quota on the specified printer.
          
        - A small display bug in repykota was introduced in preliminary 
          1.03 versions, and fixed later on.
          
        - Some minor bugs which happened in rare situations were fixed.
        
        - Support for AppleTalk printers was added, see sample configuration
          file for details.
          
        - Users and group printing can now be controlled (limited) either by  
          print quota or by account balance.
        
    - 1.02 :
    
        - The installation script now checks for software availability
          and in case a software is missing asks the user if he
          wants to continue with the installation or abort it.
          
        - The configuration file pykota.conf is now expected to be 
          found in /etc instead of in /etc/cups
          The installation script prompts the user to see if he
          wants to move an old configuration file to the new location
          if needed.
          
        - Improved documentation.
        
        - You can now set the tcp/ip port on which the Quota Storage
          Server is listening, see sample configuration file for details.
        
        - Better general error handling.
        
        - Upgrade script for pre 1.01 PostgreSQL database schema is now
          included as well.
        
    - 1.01 :
    
        - The configuration file now accepts an option   
          to choose the recipient(s) of the email messages :
          
            - DevNull means no one will receive them.
            - User means only the user will receive them.
            - Admin means only the admin will receive them.
            - Both means the User and the Admin will receive them.
            
        - The configuration file now uses hard-coded default values
          when an option is not set. See sample configuration file
          for details.
          
        - Manual pages are included since 1.00, but I forgot to    
          add this information to this file.
          
        - Redistribution terms for the official package have  
          softened and are now fully GPL compatible : 
          unrestricted modification is now allowed even for
          the version number.
          
    - 1.00 :
    
        - edpykota now accepts a --noquota option. This
          disable quota checking while still doing page
          accounting. This is really useful for people
          who don't want to limit their users but want
          to know how much pages they print.
          
        - Some untested scripts were added to retrieve
          the life time page counter of non-SNMP printers.
          
        - Every directory now has a specific README file.  
        
    - 0.99 :
    
        - Under some circumstances while the user wasn't allowed
          to print, he didn't receive any email message. It is
          now fixed.
          
        - When an user wasn't allowed to print, the quota for
          the previous user wasn't updated. This is now fixed.
          
    - 0.98 :
    
        - Correctly handle the case where the printer is switched off.
        
        - Small bug wrt syslog fixed.
        
    - 0.97 :
    
        - edpykota accepts wildcards on its command line for users/groups too
          if the --add option is not set, e.g. :
          
              $ edpykota --printer lp --softlimit 50 --hardlimit 100 "jer*"
              
        - If no user name is passed at all, then a default wildcard of "*"
          which means apply the command on ALL users for this printer is used.
          
        - Small bug fixes.
        
    - 0.96 :

        - Options requester, policy, admin, adminmail and gracedelay can now
          be set either globally or per printer. The printer option has
          priority if both are defined.

        - More powerful configuration parser.
        
        - If all options are defined globally, there's no need to 
          define a section for each printer in the configuration
          file anymore. Just define a [global] section and it's ok.

    - 0.95 :

        - External requesters for printers finally added.

        - Full internationalization (english and french are supported)
 
        - More complete quota usage report

        - CGI script to access to the quota usage report

        - Several bugs fixed.


    - 0.9 : 

        - First public version
