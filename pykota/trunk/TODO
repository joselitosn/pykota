============================================================

TODO, in no particular order :

        - Add date filtering options to dumpykota, something like 
                date=+20050101 date=-20050201
          to dump all jobs printed between January 1st 2005 included      
          and February 1st 2005 not included. This looks ugly but
          at least we avoid the problematic '<' and '>' on command
          lines, which would mandate the use of quotes...
        
        - Make the PyKota's logo URL a new configuration directive.
        
        - Pass-through mode for printers : history correctly filled (including
          job size) but no impact on user's page counter or account
          balance : this is meant to be a temporary situation for
          a printer to be in pass-through mode, for example during
          an exam where the faculty pays for the printouts and we
          don't want our users to complain about their credits being
          "eaten" for mandatory printouts.
          
        - Allow several levels of administrative priviledges by allowing
          files like ~pykota/pykotadmin.someusername.conf (readonly by
          user 'someusername'), and have the database server deal
          with the permissions : no need for additionnal code or data
          in PyKota's database !
        
        - Add a "printing denied" indicator on user print quota entries,  
          to temporarily forbid an user to print on a particular printer.
          
        - Maybe per user "denyduplicates" : my 5 years old daughter 
          just prints again when the printer is off...
          
        - Now that the job size is ALWAYS precomputed, add a 
          MaxJobSize attribute to users and groups (printers as
          well, maybe ?) to limit each job's size if needed.
          
        - Add precomputed job size (and price) to the history for
          controlling purpose.
          
        - Try to talk to education based distribution coordinators
          (SambaEdu, SkoleLinux, K12LTSP, ...) to see how to
          better integrate PyKota with these.
          
        - Allow soft and hard limits to be increased/decreased.
        
        - Add most configuration directives to the database itself,
          while still allowing to overwrite them with the configuration
          files at run time.
        
        - Ink accounting ala PrintBill.
        
        - Price and statistics per page format.
        
        - Add a description field to users/groups.
        
        - Allow the admin to choose an action to take when the database
          is unavailable (server is down or something like that), so
          introduce two directives :
          
            nodb: accept|reject|hold
            lognodb: /path/to/file/for/later/batch/update/of/database
        
        - CUPS accepts the "STATE: ..." message as backchannel
          data : use this to tell CUPS what action has been taken
          for current job. I did some testing but wasn't able to
          make it work...
          
        - Think about some possible client <=> PyKota dialog
          possibilities, like embedding a small web server in
          PyKota for example, or something like that.
        
        - Log something when --add is used with existing entries.
          Maybe add a new command line option to force/not force
          modification of existing entries.
          
        - Finish implementation of quota-then-balance and 
          balance-then-quota.
          
        - Introduce the pkusers command.
          pkusers --nogroup
          pkusers --ingroups gr1,gr2,... --outgroups gr3,gr4,...
          
        - Allow the --ingroups command line option to repykota, to
          report only users members of the specified groups.
          
        - Documentation...
          
        - Learn more bits of PHP to help with phpPyKotaAdmin, which
          is a GREAT tool !
       
        - Multidatabase support, e.g. store users in LDAP, quota  
          related datas in PostgreSQL, history in text file,
          and so on... For 2.0, probably not before.
