============================================================

TODO, in order of importance :

        - Add full support for printer groups, now that we know
          how simple it is to do so :-)
          
        - Add more fields to the job history (title, originating  
          host name, number of copies, ...)
          
        - Documentation...
          
        - Find a way to fill the 'email' field in the PgStorage.
          Should we write to it too in the LDAPStorage ?
          
        - Complete web administrative interface with graphical reports.
       
        - Group administrators (think quotagrpdmins for disk quotas).
          Won't be implemented for now.
