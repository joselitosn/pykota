============================================================

TODO, in no particular order :

        - Add an MD5 checksum of the job's datas to the
          history, to be able to discover duplicate print
          jobs.
          
        - Add --hardreset command line option to
          edpykota to also reset lifetime page counters to 0.
          
        - Maybe put "gracedelay" in the database.
        
        - Allow admin to specify a prefix to delete from
          usernames when printing, just like what is done
          for the "utolower" directive.
          Better : allow the admin to set the Samba's
          winbind separator value (or do this automatically)
          and split the domain from the username automagically
          (but only if the admin asks so).
          
        - Price multiplier/divisor which can be set on a per
          user or per user group basis.

        - Ink accounting ala PrintBill.
        
        - Price and statistics per page format.
        
        - Add a description field to users/groups.
        
        - Allow the admin to choose an action to take when the database
          is unavailable (server is down or something like that) :
          introduce two directives :
          
            nodb: accept|reject|hold
            lognodb: /path/to/file/for/later/batch/update/of/database
        
        - CUPS accepts the "STATE: ..." message as backchannel
          data : use this to tell CUPS what action has been taken
          for current job.
          
        - Add frontbanner and rearbanner directives to pykota.conf
          This directives will allow the launch (if executable)
          or the use of the banner path passed as a parameter.
          If executable, the banner content will be taken from
          the command's output, else from the banner file 
          directly. 
          
          Maybe allow frontbanner: +somepath and 
                      frontbanner: -somepath
          to allow/deny accounting of the banner itself
          (not sure because may be VERY DIFFICULT !)
          
        - Think about some possible client <=> PyKota dialog
          possibilities, like embedding a small web server in
          PyKota for example, or something like that.
        
        - Log something when --add is used with existing entries.
          Maybe add a new command line option to force/not force
          modification of existing entries.
          
        - Finish implementation of quota-then-balance and 
          balance-then-quota.
          
        - Test and document a possible workaround for knowing
          if the job is a banner (embed a postscript comment
          in the banner).
          
        - Introduce the pkusers command.
          pkusers --nogroup
          pkusers --ingroups gr1,gr2,... --outgroups gr3,gr4,...
          
        - Ensures data are stored in a consistent way with Unicode :
          I can't reproduce the problem.
        
        - Allow the --ingroups command line option to repykota, to
          report only users members of the specified groups.
          
        - Documentation...
          
        - Complete web administrative interface with graphical reports.
       
        - Group administrators (think quotagrpdmins for disk quotas).
          Won't be implemented for now.
          
        - Multidatabase support, e.g. store users in LDAP, quota  
          related datas in PostgreSQL, history in text file,
          and so on... For 2.0, probably not before.
