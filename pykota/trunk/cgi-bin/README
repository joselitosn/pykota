====================================================================

This directory contains CGI scripts which you may find useful to
put on a web server along with PyKota command line tools.

Be sure to restrict access to these CGI scripts as necessary.

If you protect access to printquota.cgi with user+password
authentication, the REMOTE_USER CGI environment variable
is honored, so an user can only see his own quota report, but
not other users' quota.

To make dumpykota.cgi work, you have to ensure that your web server 
runs it as a PyKota administrator. This means that dumpykota.cgi 
when run must be able to read the pykotadmin.conf file. There are 
several ways to do so, one of them is to put the user your web 
server normally runs as into the pykota group (which must be allowed 
to read pykotadmin.conf), then restart your web server :
            
            $ adduser www-data pykota
            $ /etc/init.d/apache restart
            
This is probably not the safest way though, so you may want to            
restrict access further with an username and password, or use
Apache's suExec mechanism to directly run this particular 
script as the pykota system user. Please refer to your web
server's documentation for details.
        
The web server doesn't need to be a print server nor a PyKota 
Storage Backend server, but it must contain a correctly configured 
PyKota installation.
