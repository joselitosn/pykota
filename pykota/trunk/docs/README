====================================================================

This directory contains PyKota documentation in DocBook format.

Unless you've purchased an official PyKota package, you're on your 
own to compile the DocBook source files to output formats like HTML 
or PDF. 

WARNING : PyKota documentation is currently at an early stage so 
purchased PyKota packages don't actually contain output formats, but 
purchasers will be sent the documentation in HTML, PS, and PDF as 
soon as it is finished.
