  <para>
    To account for pages or eventually ink usage 
    <footnote>
      <para>
        PyKota doesn't currently account for ink usage, it only accounts
        pages. To account for ink usage, you should use PrintBill instead for now.
      </para>  
    </footnote>  
    , you must plug your accounting
    system somewhere into the printing system you use, be it either <application>CUPS</application>
    or <application>LPRng</application>. One way to do this without having
    to modify the printing system itself, is by using a <firstterm>filter</firstterm>.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    A filter is a computer program which takes data in one format as its input, and outputs the
    same data but transformed into another format. <application>CUPS</application> already
    contains many filters. For example there's one filter named <filename>pstops</filename> which accepts 
    PostScript data as its input, and, as its name implies, outputs PostScript data too, but after having
    eventually rearranged the pages to fit several pages on a single sheet of paper, or other manipulations
    like that. <application>LPRng</application> also contains several filters like this.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The <filename>pstops</filename> filter described above is also in charge of doing basic page
    accounting, but <application>PyKota</application> currently doesn't use this facility since it may
    prove to be unreliable depending on the drivers used or if a paper jam occurs for example.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    <application>LPRng</application> can also use filters, often used in combination with
    <application>LPRng</application> are <application>magicfilter</application> which can convert 
    different input formats to native printers languages like PostScript or ESC/P2 and 
    <application>ifhp</application> which can do low-level accounting.
  </para>  
  
  <para>
    So to do its own accounting, <application>PyKota</application> has its own filters, for <application>CUPS</application>
    it's named <filename>cupspykota</filename>, which is in fact a <application>CUPS</application> backends wrapper,
    and for <application>LPRng</application> it's named <filename>lprngpykota</filename>, as you have probably guessed.
    The procedure to plug the correct filter into your printing system is described in the 
    <xref linkend="installation" endterm="installation"> chapter.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Currently with a <application>CUPS</application> internal accounting mechanism, the <filename>pstops</filename>
    filter can be bypassed. That's why <application>PyKota</application> uses its own backend.
    The <filename>cupspykota</filename> backend wrapper ensures that jobs can't bypass it, so you can use
    any printer with any driver and any command line option, and you can be sure that your
    print job will be correctly accounted for.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    When using the <literal>hardware</literal> accounting method,
    <application>PyKota</application> launches the script you specified to
    ask the printer for its internal page counter at the start and at the end of the print job, and
    computes the values' difference to know the job's size. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
    When using the <literal>software</literal> accounting method,
    the command you specified is launched with the job's data on its 
    standard input. Your command must print the job's size in number of
    pages on a single line on its standard output. This number is then
    read by <application>PyKota</application> and used to update the current user's quota information.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    If a problem occurs, it is logged either to the filter's standard error or to the system logger, depending on
    your preferences in <application>PyKota</application>'s configuration files. Also if a print quota is reached
    you may choose if the administrator, the user, both or no-one will receive an email message explaining
    the situation and proposing a solution. You can even configure another action instead of sending email
    messages if you want.
  </para>
