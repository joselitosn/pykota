  <title>Installation</title>
  <para>
    Before being able to use <application>PyKota</application>, you have of course to
    install it first. But before installing, you must carefully plan your installation.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    First you have to determine which machine will be the <application>PyKota</application>
    <glossaryterm>Storage Server</glossaryterm>. The Storage Server is the host responsible
    for keeping a centralized database of print usage for all your printers, users and groups.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Then you have to list all the <glossaryterm>Print Servers</glossaryterm> for which
    you plan to use <glossaryterm>print quota</glossaryterm> facilities.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Now we will see what has to be done on all those servers.
    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>
        Of course, depending on the size of your network, you may very well
        use the same machine as both a Print Server and a Storage Server.
        This is especially the case if you've got only one server.
      </para>
    </note>  
  </para>

    <title>Storage Server Installation</title>
    
    <para>
      Depending on <application>PyKota</application>'s version number, different
      types of storage backends may be supported, so we will see for each one of
      them how to configure it.
    </para>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>PostgreSQL</title>
      
      <para>
        <application>PostgreSQL</application> is an <glossaryterm>Object Relationnal DataBase
        Management System</glossaryterm> distributed under a <glossaryterm>Free Software</glossaryterm>
        license from the 
        <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org">http://www.postgresql.org</ulink>
        web site. It certainely is the free <acronym>RDBMS</acronym> which has the most advanced
        features, and is widely used all over the world.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To configure your Storage Server, you must have PostgreSQL already working.
        The complete installation of <application>PostgreSQL</application> is not covered by
        the present manual, please refer to your system's documentation or to 
        <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org">http://www.postgresql.org</ulink> for
        details.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        One thing you have to check, though, is that every Print Server on which you
        want to install the print quota mechanism must be able to connect to the
        <application>PostgreSQL</application> server. In the default installation of
        <application>PostgreSQL</application> this may not be the case for security reasons, except if both
        servers are in fact the same machine. In any case, it is recommended that you
        check the <filename>/etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf</filename> and modify it if
        needed. This file is self documented and its modification is straightforward.
        <tip>
          <title>Tip</title>
          <para>
            Don't forget to restart <application>PostgreSQL</application> if you modify
            any of its configuration files, in order for the changes to take effect.
          </para>
        </tip>  
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Be careful, you may be unable to connect from a Print Server to the <application>PostgreSQL</application>
        server even if the configuration is correct. Sometimes your connections may be blocked by
        one or more network firewalls along the route from one machine to the other. If this
        is the case, then the best thing you can do is to ask your <glossaryterm>Network Administrator</glossaryterm>
        to not filter the IP port used by <application>PostgreSQL</application>, which is
        usually port 5432/tcp.
        <tip>
          <title>Tip</title>
          <para>
            The TCP/IP network port used by PostgreSQL may be different. When in doubt, ask your 
            <glossaryterm>System Administrator</glossaryterm> for the correct value.
          </para>

    <title>Print Server Installation</title>
    
    <para>
      For each Print Server on which you plan to implement the print quota
      mechanism, you have, of course, to have an already working printing environment. 
      Currently <application>PyKota</application> only works with the
      <ulink url="http://www.cups.org"><application>CUPS</application></ulink> environment,
      but more may be added in the future.
