  <title>Detects the best settings for your printers with pkhint</title>
  <para>Last modified on $Date$</para>
  
  <para>
    <filename>pkhint</filename> is an experimental command designed with the goal to 
    help you find the best <application>PyKota</application> settings for each of your
    printers.
  </para>  
  
  <para>
    Currently <filename>pkhint</filename> only recognizes <application>CUPS</application>' <filename>printers.conf</filename>
    file format, but <application>LPRng</application>' <filename>printcap</filename> file format support will be added
    in the future.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    <filename>pkhint</filename> accepts optional printers names as its arguments, and reads your printing system's
    printers configuration file from stdin. Then it launches different tests to see if your printers supports
    some special features which would allow you to use either hardware or software accounting on them, with
    a preference for hardware since it's more reliable. If it can help you, it will print some text which
    you will be able to copy and paste into <filename>~pykota/pykota.conf</filename>.
  </para>
  
  <warning>
    <title>Warning</title>
    <para>
      Because <filename>pkhint</filename> is still a work in progress, don't expect it to allow you
      to fully configure <application>PyKota</application> for you. You'll still have to double
      check that your configuration is correct.
