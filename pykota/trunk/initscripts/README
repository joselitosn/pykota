============================================================

This directory contains scripts to initialise the PyKota
storage database. Use the one which best suits your need
depending on the storage backend you want to use.


Files :
=======

  * pykota-postgresql.sql :
  
    This file creates an empty Quota Storage Database, using PostgreSQL
    as a backend. You have to use it the first time you install PyKota
    if you want to use PostgreSQL as the Quota Storage Backend.
    
  * pykota-upgrade-postgresql.sql :
  
    This files upgrades the PostgreSQL Quota Storage Database schema
    from versions before 1.01 to version 1.01.
    
  * upgrade-1.01-to-1.03.sh :
  
    This shell script upgrades the PostgreSQL Quota Storage Database schema
    from versions 1.01 or 1.02 to version 1.03.
    PLEASE DO A BACKUP OF YOUR PYKOTA DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING THIS SCRIPT !
    Also this script will try to connect to PostgreSQL as the postgres user
    (i.e. PostgreSQL's administrator), on the local machine (PyKota Storage 
    Server), without prompting for a password. Please read this script and 
    adapt it to your own configuration before running it. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
