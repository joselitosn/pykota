Documentation for the pykota-mysql.sql script :
-----------------------------------------------

This script is to be used to create an empty Quota Storage
DataBase using MySQL as a backend.

FOR NOW MYSQL SUPPORT IS ONLY A WORK IN PROGRESS. THIS DOESN'T WORK. 
DON'T TOUCH THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING OR WANT TO HELP. 

IF YOU REALLY WANT MYSQL SUPPORT, BE PATIENT, OR USE POSTGRESQL
INSTEAD WHICH IS MUCH MUCH BETTER ANYWAY.
