pykota.sqlite :

    This file can be used to create an empty SQLite3 database
    for use with PyKota, in the case you don't want to use
    either LDAP or PostgreSQL.
    
    NB : an SQLite3 database can't be shared between several
    PyKota managed print servers, contrarily to LDAP or 
    PostgreSQL.
    
    HowTo :
    
      - Install SQLite v3.2.7 or higher, and its development files,
        for example on my Debian box :
        
                # apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
                
        You can also download SQLite from http://www.sqlite.org        

      - Download and install PySQLite v2.0.5 or higher from :
      
                http://www.pysqlite.org

        Install it this way :

                # tar -zxf pysqlite-2.0.5.tar.gz
                # cd pysqlite-2.0.5
                # python setup.py install
                
      - Create an SQLite3 database for PyKota :

                # sqlite3 ~pykota/pykota.db <pykota.sqlite
                # chown pykota.pykota ~pykota/pykota.db
                # chmod 660 ~pykota/pykota.db
                # chown pykota.pykota ~pykota       (seems to be necessary)
                
        NB : adapt the permissions so that the user your printing
             system runs as (e.g. user 'lp') can read and write
             to the /etc/pykota/pykota.db file.
                
      - In pykotadmin.conf, just comment out all the lines

      - In pykota.conf, set :

                storagebackend : sqlitestorage
                storagename : /etc/pykota/pykota.db
                
        And comment out all other directives which name begins with 'storage'.
        NB : feel free to use a different path to store pykota.db, and
             adapt your configuration files accordingly.
                
Your PyKota setup is now ready to be used with an SQLite3 database.
