Set a textual description for the specified printers.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR GROUPS, \fB\-\-groups\fR=\fIGROUPS\fR
If the \fB\-\-remove\fR option is not used, the default action
is to add the specified printers to the specified
printers groups. Otherwise they are removed from these
groups. The specified printers groups must already
exist, and should be created beforehand just like
normal printers with this very command.
.TP

Display detailed informations about the specified
printers.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR MAXJOBSIZE, \fB\-\-maxjobsize\fR=\fIMAXJOBSIZE\fR

printing, 'unlimited' to allow unrestricted printing,
or any positive integer value.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nopassthrough\fR
Deactivate passthrough mode for the specified
printers. This is the normal mode of operations, in
which print jobs are accounted for, and are checked
against printing quotas and available credits.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-passthrough\fR
Activate passthrough mode for the specified printers.
In this mode, jobs sent to these printers are not
accounted for. This can be useful for exams during

When combined with the \fB\-\-groups\fR option, remove
printers from the specified printers groups.

Would create three printers named 'hp2100', and 'hp2200' in PyKota's
database, while telling CUPS to route all print jobs through PyKota for
these printers. Each of them would have 'HP Printer' as its description.

for each job.

Would delete all existing printers and matching print quota entries and
printing history from PyKota's database. USE WITH CARE.

printers groups, which must already exist.
