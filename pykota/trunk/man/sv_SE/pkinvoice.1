will automatically be incremented for each invoice.
.TP

set to '\-', the PDF document is sent to standard
output.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR | \fB\-\-unit\fR u

The default unit is 'Credits', optionally translated
to your native language if it is supported by PyKota.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR | \fB\-\-vat\fR p
Sets the percent value of the applicable VAT to be
exposed. The default is 0.0, meaning no VAT

Sets the starting date for the print jobs invoiced.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR | \fB\-\-end\fR date
Sets the ending date for the print jobs invoiced.
.IP
user1 through userN can use wildcards if needed. If no user argument is
used, a wildcard of '*' is assumed, meaning include all users.
.IP
Dates formating with \fB\-\-start\fR and \fB\-\-end\fR :
.IP
YYYY : year boundaries
YYYYMM : month boundaries
YYYYMMDD : day boundaries
YYYYMMDDhh : hour boundaries
YYYYMMDDhhmm : minute boundaries
YYYYMMDDhhmmss : second boundaries
yesterday[+\-NbDays] : yesterday more or less N days (e.g. : yesterday\-15)
today[+\-NbDays] : today more or less N days (e.g. : today\-15)
tomorrow[+\-NbDays] : tomorrow more or less N days (e.g. : tomorrow\-15)
now[+\-NbDays] : now more or less N days (e.g. now\-15)
.IP
\&'now' and 'today' are not exactly the same since today represents the first
or last second of the day depending on if it's used in a start= or end=
date expression. The utility to be able to specify dates in the future is
a question which remains to be answered :\-)
.PP
examples :

.IP
Will generate a PDF document containing invoices for all users
