This directory contains some screenshots of direct access to PyKota's
database through OpenOffice.org

Since it works but I don't know OpenOffice enough to do something nice
with it, I've added these screenshots and here's a small howto :

        - Install and configure :
        
          godbcconfig
          gtkodbcconfig0
          iodbc
          libiodbc2
          odbc-postgresql
          odbcinst1
          unixodbc
          
        - Within gODBCConfig, add the PostgreSQL driver by 
          filling the Configure Driver form :
          
                   Name : PostgreSQL
            Description : PostgreSQL
                 Driver : /usr/lib/postgresql/psqlodbc.so
                  Setup : /usr/lib/odbc/libodbcpsqlS.so
              FileUsage : 1
        
          See gODBCConfig1.png
          
          Then create a system DSN (only the more important fields
          are listed below) :
          
                   DSN : PyKota
           Description : PostgreSQL access to PyKota
                Driver : PostgreSQL
              Database : pykota
            Servername : your.postgresql.server.here
              Username : pykotauser
              Password : pykotauser's password
                  Port : 5432
                  
          See gODBCConfig2.png
          
        - Then in OpenOffice.org add a new data source, selecting
          ODBC in the Database Type field. By clicking on the URL
          field's continuation dots, the PyKota DSN should appear.
          Just select it and you're done.
          
          See ooo1.png
          
        - You can now create your own queries to the PyKota database,
          and create any report you want.
          
          See ooo2.png
          
        - When you've got something nice, please contribute it back  
          so we can learn from your experience.
